# DrugViz
CS: Visual analytics (VA) project 

The EU's drug policy for youth focuses on *prevention*, *education*, harm reduction, and early intervention to reduce drug use and its negative impacts.

Raising Awareness: Clearly presenting drug use statistics and risks helps young people understand the prevalence and dangers of drug use in their community.

Highlighting Support Resources: Visualizations can map available support services, such as counseling centers, harm reduction programs, or hotlines, making it easier for youth to seek help.

Encouraging Prevention: By showcasing the effectiveness of preventive measures or trends in reduced drug use, visualizations can inspire positive behavior.

Fostering Engagement: Interactive and engaging visualizations can capture attention, making it easier for young people to absorb and act on important information.
